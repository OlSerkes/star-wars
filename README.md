#Star Wars database application.
For this app was used https://swapi.dev/ for data and https://starwars-visualguide.com/ for images.
This was my project built during Online React Marathon at SoftServe IT Academy.
Project goal was create application that show:

- image with SW person
- h3 tag with name
- li elements with:
  - Gender
  - Birth Year
  - Eye color
- Button "NEXT". It loads the next person.
  And the same for "Planets" and "Starships".
  Their data cards will have at least 3 data fields.
  At the top of the page, added a Header component. Clicking on the corresponding header menu, only the required component is rendered. People is render by default.
